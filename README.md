Tasks
Fully implement the given UI on a level of functional detail you deem necessary. For your implementation use NextJS, Tailwind CSS, React Testing Library and any other frameworks or tools you see necessary.
UI has to be performant - feel free to pick your approach on loading all the data like creating a light dummy API interface around it or something completely different.
Bonus
If you spot any UX issues on this page feel free to address them in your implementation and share your thoughts with us during our chat.
