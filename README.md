# Frontend Engineer Challenge

To facilitate our discussion during technical interview, we ask our candidates to build the following small part of our Live Market list using static data provided. 

Reference design is hosted in <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a> (account is needed for Inspect mode)

  <li>
      Static JSON files representing different sections of the Live Market activity are in this directory (<a href="https://github.com/rooser-eu/frontend-engineer-challenge/tree/main/data">data</a>).
      <ul>
        <li>Accepted Orders - data/accepted_orders.json</li>
        <li>Live Demand - data/live_demand.json</li>
        <li>Recent Activity - data/recent_activity.json</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Please share your solution with us in the form of a public Git repository.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Task</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Fully implement the given UI on a level of functional detail you deem necessary. For your implementation setup a monorepo and use NextJS, Tailwind CSS, React Testing Library and any other frameworks or tools you see necessary.</li>
  <li>UI has to be performant - feel free to pick your approach on loading all the data like creating a light dummy API interface around it or something completely different.</li>
  <li>Make sure you have picked an appropriate testing strategy and your code is well tested.</li>
  <li>You can use any design system of your choice for this exercise. We are not expecting you to implement a pixel perfect match of the UI without having access to Rooser design system.</li>
</ul>
  
<strong>Bonus</strong>
<ul>
  <li>If you spot any UX issues on this page feel free to address them in your implementation and share your thoughts with us during our chat.</li>
</ul>
